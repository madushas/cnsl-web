Nice — this is a great next step. Below I’ve designed a complete, practical plan for a web app at `connect.cloudnative.lk` to manage a full CNSL Connect cohort from applications → matching → mentoring → wrap-up — while keeping meetings on external platforms (Zoom / Meet / etc.).

You’ll get:

* a prioritized feature set (MVP → v2),
* detailed user flows for Organizers / Mentors / Mentees,
* a data model and API sketch,
* key UI pages and copy ideas,
* integrations and automation suggestions,
* operational rules (matching, re-pairing, certificates, forms), and
* a realistic rollout plan + hosting/tech suggestions.

I thought through the program history you shared (document-driven workflow, mentor time constraints, need for project/goal-based tracks), and optimized the app for *lightweight, evidence-first, low-friction* usage.

# connect.cloudnative.lk — Product spec (summary → full)

## TL;DR (one-paragraph)

A lightweight cohort-management webapp to run CNSL Connect end-to-end: public landing + applications, mentor sign-up & availability, automated (or manual) matching, document-driven session tracking (artifacts & session logs), mid/final review forms, certificate generation, cohort analytics, and admin tools. Meetings remain external: the app stores meeting links, agendas and records artifacts, and handles scheduling hand-offs (Calendly / Zoom/Google Meet links). MVP focuses on core workflows (apply → match → log → evaluate → certify), with future enhancements for project banks, rubrics, and structured tracks.

---

# 1 — Core user roles & permissions

* **Public (anonymous)** — view landing, resources, FAQ, eligibility, apply/mentor-register forms.
* **Applicant / Mentee (account)** — complete application & focus plan, view application status, view mentor profile (post-accept), access dashboard, upload artifacts, fill mid/final forms, request help, download certificate (if eligible).
* **Mentor (account)** — create profile, set availability & preferred mentee profile (background/track), accept pairing, view assigned mentees, upload resources, log sessions & artifacts, complete mid/final mentor evaluation, optionally request re-pairing.
* **Organizer / Admin** — cohort settings, view all applications, match (auto/manual), send bulk emails/WhatsApp, generate reports, manage project bank/tracks, issue certificates, moderate content, export/import data.
* **Read-only roles** (optional): Community manager, PR person.

Access rules:

* Mentors see only their assigned mentees and anonymized aggregate data outside assignments.
* Mentees see only their mentor(s) and their own artifacts.
* Organizers see everything; sensitive data access controlled via audit logs.

---

# 2 — MVP feature list (essential; launch in 1 cohort cycle)

**Public & Onboarding**

1. Landing page describing program + CTAs (Apply as Mentee / Register as Mentor).
2. Authentication via OAuth (Google, GitHub) + email sign-up. (Ease of use: reduce friction.)
3. Application forms:

   * Mentee: profile, focus plan, availability, sample artifacts, consent for public recognition.
   * Mentor: profile, expertise tags, availability, capacity (max mentees), preferred tracks.

**Core cohort management**
4. Admin dashboard: applications queue, approval/rejection, waitlist management, simple filters (university, experience, availability).
5. Matching engine:

* Auto-match algorithm (configurable weights: track, time overlap, mentee level, mentor capacity).
* Manual override & re-pair feature.
* Waitlist handling + auto-notify on new slots.

**Mentorship lifecycle**
6. Pairing confirmation flows: automated emails + in-app notifications.
7. Meeting scheduling placeholder: store meeting link (Zoom/Meet/Calendly), scheduled date/time and timezone. (External scheduling only; optionally add Calendly/Google Calendar integration.)
8. Session logging: mentors and mentees can log session date, minutes, short notes, and attach artifacts and links (GitHub, demo). Minimal friction: quick form with template options.
9. Asynchronous check-ins: allow doc uploads and text interactions (not full chat) — keep it lightweight.
10. Form collection system: create & publish midterm + final evaluation forms for mentors and mentees (Google Forms embed or built-in forms). Responses tied to user records for reporting.

**Outcomes & certificates**
11. Evidence bank: per-mentee repository of links & uploaded artifacts (repo links, docs, demos).
12. Certificate generation: PDF template populated with mentor name, mentee name, track, outcome (use wkhtmltopdf or Puppeteer). Certificates downloadable and emailed.
13. Eligibility engine: simple rule-based logic to auto-flag certificate eligibility (e.g., minimum sessions, form completion, artifact presence). Organizers can override.

**Admin / reporting**
14. Cohort summary report (auto-generate): participation stats, sessions avg, artifacts, satisfaction scores. Export CSV / PDF.
15. Notifications: email + optional SMS/WhatsApp integration for high-priority announcements.
16. Resource library: project bank + starter repos + session toolkits (admin-curated).
17. Audit logs & data export (CSV / JSON).

---

# 3 — Valuable v2 features (post-MVP, optional)

* Project bank with acceptance criteria & milestone checklists (mentors + mentees track progress against milestones).
* Milestone-based automated reminders and micro-badges.
* Integrated calendar scheduling with Google/Zoom API for one-click meeting creation.
* Lightweight messaging (mentors ↔ mentees) inside app (or Slack integration).
* Public showcase page for completed projects (with mentee permission).
* Mentor leaderboard, community recognition pages, analytics dashboards (PostHog).
* Multi-cohort support & cohort templates.
* Automatic certificate signature image & LinkedIn integration to add certificate.

---

# 4 — Deep user flows (step-by-step)

### Flow A — Public → Mentee Application → Acceptance (detailed)

1. Public landing page → click **Apply** → sign in (Google/GitHub).
2. Mentee application (form): personal info, university, CV/GitHub, 1-paragraph focus plan (goal + time availability + constraints), preferred tracks, sample artifacts, consent checkboxes. Save as draft allowed.
3. Submit → auto-ack email with application ID + expected response date.
4. Organizer reviews: quick triage filters (auto or manual). Decision options: Accept / Waitlist / Reject (with reason).
5. If accepted: create Mentee account, prompt to finish profile, link to resource library, onboarding checklist (watch intro video, read code of conduct, fill “first meeting agenda” template).
6. If waitlisted: auto-notify with position and expected timeline.

**Business rules & UX details**

* Applicants can update focus plan until matching cutoff.
* Require basic consent & code of conduct confirmation.
* Provide an editable "First meeting agenda" template saved to their dashboard to bring to their first mentor meeting (reduces mentor prep overhead).

---

### Flow B — Mentor registration & availability

1. Mentor signs up → short curated form: expertise tags (Kubernetes, IaC, CI/CD...), years experience, company, timezone, preferred mentee level, capacity (# mentees), types of commitment (weekly / bi-weekly), LinkedIn/GitHub. Option to upload a short bio and headshot.
2. Organizer verifies mentors (optional manual check). Auto email confirming signup & included in mentor pool.
3. Mentors can update availability calendar window (preferred meeting windows) and choose to share Calendly link if they want to be directly booked.

**UX detail:** default privacy: mentors can choose to be publicly listed as mentors (with bio) or be private.

---

### Flow C — Matching & pairing

**Auto-match algorithm** (configurable):

* Score = w1*TrackMatch + w2*AvailabilityOverlap + w3*ExperienceDelta + w4*PreferenceMatch + w5*DiversityBoost.
* Expose admin UI to tweak weights and run previews.

**Manual ops:**

* Admin gets match candidates list with score and can either accept or manually assign.
* When pairing is done:

  * Mentor receives pairing email + mentee profile + suggested first meeting agenda.
  * Mentee receives pairing email + mentor profile + onboarding checklist.
  * Both see the pair in their dashboard with an “Initial meeting planned?” toggle and a placeholder for meeting link.

**Edge cases & rules**

* Mentors have capacity cap; system ensures not to exceed.
* If mentee not matched within cut-off, add to waitlist; show progress to applicant.
* Provide a short “pairing rationale” visible to organizers for audit (why matched).

---

### Flow D — Session lifecycle (asynchronous-first)

1. After pairing, mentor or mentee schedules meeting externally (Zoom/Meet) — add meeting link to the pairing page and set meeting date/time (organizer optional).
2. After each meeting, mentor (or mentee) fills a **Session Log**: date, duration, summary (one-paragraph), action items, links to artifacts. Minimal fields; optionally allow uploading one file. Quick save button.
3. Session logs accumulate; system displays a timeline per pairing. Organizers can view aggregated logs.
4. Between meetings: mentee uploads artifacts (repos, docs), marks milestones in project bank (if using). Mentor approves or comments on artifacts (comment threads optional in v2).
5. Soft reminders (email) if no session logged in X days (configurable).

**Design principle:** prefer mentor logging but allow mentee logging — system accepts both and shows "last logged by X."

---

### Flow E — Midterm review & interventions

1. At predefined mid-date, system sends midterm forms: mentors + mentees (forms we already designed).
2. Collect responses → auto-aggregate metrics and trigger rules:

   * If mentor reports “not connected” → auto-assign organizer to intervene (send message).
   * If mentee reports “mentor not responsive” → ping mentor + cc organizer.
   * If progress is below threshold → organizer can propose re-pairing or provide curated resources.

---

### Flow F — Final evaluation & certificate issuance

1. Final forms sent to mentors/mentees (we designed these).
2. Collect evidence: session logs count, artifacts present, final mentor rating, mentee self-eval, meet threshold logic.
3. System auto-flags eligible mentees; organizers review & confirm.
4. Certificates generated and emailed; updates shown on mentee dashboard with download link.
5. Closing session scheduled (date TBA) — invite list auto-populated from records; organizers add meeting link later.

---

# 5 — Data model (high level)

Core tables (Postgres style):

```
users
- id, name, email, role(enum:admin,mentor,mentee), auth_provider, created_at, last_active

mentor_profiles
- user_id(fk), bio, company, expertise_tags(json), capacity, timezone, availability(json/calendar link), public_profile(bool), linkedin, github

mentee_profiles
- user_id, university, year, status (student/grad/professional), focus_plan(text), availability, linked_repos

applications
- id, user_id, role_applied(enum), form_data(json), status(enum:submitted,accepted,waitlist,rejected), submitted_at, decision_at, reviewer_id

pairings
- id, mentor_id, mentee_id, cohort_id, status(enum:active,paused,completed), matched_at, notes

sessions
- id, pairing_id, author_id, date, duration_minutes, summary_text, action_items, artifact_links(json), created_at

forms_responses
- id, user_id, form_type(enum), responses(json), submitted_at

artifacts
- id, user_id, pairing_id, type, link, description, visibility(enum)

certificates
- id, user_id, pairing_id, cohort_id, pdf_url, issued_at, signed_by

cohorts

# 7 — UX / key screens & micro-copy

Screens (priority order):

**Public**

* Landing: program summary, cohort dates, CTA (Apply / Mentor Register), FAQ, code of conduct, contact.
* Resources: curated project bank, starter repos, toolkits.

**Auth & Onboard**

* Sign-in (OAuth), complete profile wizard (quick).

**Applicant (mentee)**

* Application wizard: focus plan + availability (one-page multi-step), preview, submit.
* Application status page.

**Mentor**

* Mentor dashboard: assigned mentees, capacity bar, quick accept/decline pairing button.
* Mentor profile editor + availability.
* Quick “log session” modal (accessible from dashboard or pairing).

**Mentee**

* Mentee dashboard: mentor bio, next meeting (if scheduled), upload artifact button, action checklist.
* Session timeline: session logs, artifacts, “prepare for next meeting” template.

**Admin**

* Cohort overview: metrics (apps, accepted, pairings, sessions, artifacts, satisfaction scores).
* Applications queue & filters.
* Match panel: suggested matches with scores, approve / override.
* Forms manager: publish mid/final forms, view responses.
* Certificates manager: list of eligible mentees with generate button.

Micro-copy examples:

* Pairing email subject: `You’ve been matched — CNSL Connect (Mentor: [Name])`
* Session log placeholder: `What did you cover? (one or two short bullets)`
* First-meeting template: `Introduce yourself (5m) → Review focus plan (10m) → Agree 2 concrete milestones (15m) → Next steps & schedule (5m)`

# 8 — Integrations & automations

**Emails:** SendGrid or Mailgun (templated transactional emails).
**Calendar / Meetings:** optional Calendly + Zoom or Google Calendar API integration (v2 feature). For MVP, store meeting link and let users schedule externally. Provide copy/paste template for scheduling.
**WhatsApp / SMS:** Twilio (WhatsApp API) for urgent reminders (opt-in). For group messages simple organizer sends, prefer manual targeting to avoid spam.
**Storage:** S3 / Supabase Storage for file uploads. For GitHub links just store URL.
**Forms:** Either built-in form engine (recommended) or embed Google Forms for speed (easier) — built-in is better for data modeling.
**Analytics:** PostHog (self-hosted) or Google Analytics + segment.
**Certificates:** Puppeteer (render HTML template to PDF) or server-side PDF generator. Optionally sign with a signature image.

---

# 9 — Eligibility rules & rubrics (practical)

Define simple, objective rules for certificate eligibility to avoid ambiguity:

**Certificate eligibility (example)**

* Minimum session logs: 3 sessions (or X hours combined).
* Final mentee form submitted.
* Final mentor form submitted and confirms mentee status (completed/partially).
* At least one artifact link (repo, demo, doc) OR evidence of practical outcome (verified by mentor).
* Organizer confirmation flag (manual override for special circumstances).

**Rubrics**
Create a 1-page rubric per track: what “done” looks like (Deliverables + Acceptance Criteria). Examples:

* `K8s App Delivery` track: containerize app; create deployment + service; CI/CD pipeline deploying to cluster; monitoring basic health check. (list pass/fail criteria)

---

# 10 — Security & privacy (must-have)

* Enforce HTTPS everywhere.
* Access control for endpoints; role-based auth.
* Data retention policy: store forms & artifacts for cohort period + 1 year (configurable). Provide export & delete on request.
* PII handling: don’t publish email addresses or phone numbers publicly without consent. Have explicit consent checkboxes for public quotes or tagging.
* Audit logs for admin actions.
* Rate-limits and secure file uploads (virus scanning optional).
* Backup DB daily; store certificates & artifacts in long-term storage (S3 Glacier) as needed.

---

# 11 — Tech stack & hosting (recommended, pragmatic)

**Frontend**

* Next.js (React + TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS (fast, modern, mobile-first). Material You inspiration in color/shape but avoid glassmorphism.
  **Backend**
* Node.js (NestJS or Express) + TypeScript; or .NET Web API (if your team prefers .NET — both fine).
  **Database**
* Postgres (hosted on Supabase or AWS RDS). Supabase gives auth, storage and realtime useful for rapid build.
  **Storage**
* S3 or Supabase Storage.
  **Auth**
* NextAuth (OAuth) or Supabase Auth. Support Google/GitHub sign-in.
  **Email**
* SendGrid / Mailgun.
  **PDF Certificates**
* Puppeteer or wkhtmltopdf (serverless render).
  **CI/CD & Hosting**
* Frontend: Vercel or Netlify; Backend: Vercel Serverless Functions or DigitalOcean App Platform / Azure App Service (if .NET). CI via GitHub Actions.
  **Monitoring**
* Sentry + Prometheus/CloudWatch (depending on infra).
  **Optional**
* PostHog for product analytics.

# 12 — MVP roadmap & rough timeline (6–8 weeks realistic)

**Sprint 0 (1 week):** requirements & prototypes. Landing page + auth + DB schema.
**Sprint 1 (2 weeks):** application forms (mentee + mentor), admin app review queue, basic profile pages.
**Sprint 2 (2 weeks):** matching engine (manual + simple auto), pairing workflow & emails, dashboard minimal.
**Sprint 3 (2 weeks):** session logging, artifact uploads, mid/final forms, certificate generator prototype.
**Sprint 4 (1 week):** reporting & QA, deploy, handoff, documentation and run pilot with organizers.

Total: 6–8 weeks for an MVP (2–3 engineers + 1 designer + 1 product lead). If you embed Google Forms to start, you can compress to 3–4 weeks.

---

# 13 — Operational playbook (how to run a cohort using the app)

1. Publish cohort on landing + open applications.
2. Triage mentor applications first (mentor registry open) — fill mentor pool.
3. Accept mentees & collect focus plan; prepare project bank / rubric for tracks.
4. Run matching and confirm pairings. Send onboarding doc + first meeting agenda template to both parties.
5. Track session logs weekly via app; midterm forms at midpoint. Intervene based on rules.
6. Continue monitoring; collect final forms, artifacts. Use eligibility rules to flag certificate-ready folks.
7. Produce cohort summary report, prepare certificates, schedule closing session, publish write-up.

---

# 14 — Example minimal UI wireframes (textual)

* **Landing**: hero + CTA buttons (Apply / Mentor Register) + cohort dates + “How it works” three-step.
* **Apply wizard**: Step 1 profile → Step 2 focus plan → Step 3 availability → Step 4 submit & preview.
* **Dashboard (ments)**: Top: Mentor & Mentee cards, below: Session timeline, Artifacts, Actions (log session / upload).
* **Admin Match Panel**: left: mentee, right: mentor candidates with scores, center: match button.

---

# 15 — Sample emails & notification rules (essential)

* Application ack email with ID and expected date.
* Mentor registration ack & verification.
* Pairing notification to both sides with suggested first-meeting agenda + prompts.
* Weekly digest to organizers: new apps, pairings, stuck pairings.
* Midterm & final form reminders (Day 0, Day 3 reminder, Day 1 final).
* Certificate delivery email with PDF attached & link.

---

# 16 — Quick wins & low-friction starts

If you want to ship fast and validate the app concept before building everything:

* Start with a Next.js landing + Supabase auth + Google Forms embedded for applications and final forms. Store application IDs and send manual emails for matching. Use a simple Airtable as backend for pairings. This hybrid approach reduces dev time and proves process flows. After one cohort, transition to built-in forms and automations.

---

# 17 — Example matching rule (simple, explicit)

Algorithm (first pass):

1. Filter mentors with capacity > current mentees and overlapping availability.
2. Score by: +10 match if track matches, +5 for GitHub activity match, +3 if same timezone, -5 if mentee seniority much lower than mentor preferred.
3. Sort descending, show top 3 to admin. Allow “auto-assign” toggle.

---

# 18 — Measurement: KPIs to track

* Application funnel conversion (apply → accept)
* Mentor acceptance rate (% mentors who accept pairings)
* Average sessions per pairing
* Artifact completion rate (% mentees with at least 1 artifact)
* Certificate eligibility rate
* Satisfaction scores (mentee & mentor avg 1–5)
* Re-pairing rate & reasons

---

## Final note / immediate next steps I can do for you

Pick any of these and I’ll produce a deliverable right away:

1. A clickable UI flow / page-by-page copy and UX for the MVP.
2. A ready-to-paste Google Forms schema for built-in forms (if you want to avoid custom forms).
3. An initial DB schema in SQL with CREATE TABLE scripts.
4. A simple matching algorithm implementation sketch (pseudocode).
5. An email/template pack for all lifecycle events.

Tell me which one you want first and I’ll generate it now.
